## 🌍 About the Project
This is a playful little Python script that calculates your weight on other planets.  
Because space should be admired more, and we deserve to know how _snatched_ we’d be on Mars.

**You just:**
1. Input your Earth weight (in **kg**).
2. Choose a planet from the list.
3. Get your interplanetary weight, instantly. Like magic. Cosmic magic.

## 🧪 Sample Output
Welcome to the Interplanetary Weight Calculator! 🚀
Enter the number for the planet you want to visit:
1. Mercury
2. Venus
3. Mars
4. Jupiter
5. Saturn
6. Uranus
7. Neptune

🌍 What is your Earth weight (kg)? 60

🪐 Choose your planet number (1-7): 3

✨ On this planet, you would weigh about 22.8 kg!
